## 👩‍💻 The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file
