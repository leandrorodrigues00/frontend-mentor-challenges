## 👩‍💻 The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- Bonus: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
- Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
