## 👩‍💻 The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This project is a collaboration between us, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell. If you'd like to see how Kevin would tackle the project, you can follow along on Scrimba's free course.

If you're working through it yourself, please use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file for the different page data. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
- Download the project and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project and help you get set up.
